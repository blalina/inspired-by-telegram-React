# Chat App appearance taken from telegram

This is a simple chat application created using React.js library working in Vite, with the view inspired by the popular messaging app Telegram.

What the app can do:

- search and select a user via search;
- keep separate correspondence with users;
- send messages and attach files to their messages. Attached files are displayed in the chat window along with the messages.
