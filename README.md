# Chat App

SPA built with React.js using Vite, with the view inspired by the popular messaging app Telegram.

Description:

The app accesses <https://alina-api-mock-server.onrender.com/api-docs/static/index.html>
Information about users is taken from the API, correspondence with the user is displayed and the possibility to save sent messages is displayed.

What the app can do:

-   Searching and selecting users through a search feature.
-   Working with APIs: sending requests to the server and handling responses.
-   Keep separate correspondence with users.
-   Sending messages and attaching files, which are displayed in the chat window along with messages.
-   Retrieving coordinates and dynamically adjusting block width when resizing with the mouse.
